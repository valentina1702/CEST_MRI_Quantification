# CEST_MRI_Quantification


#### This repository demonstartes some of my work in Image analysis using CEST MRI Images to quantify the parameters of small brain metabolites in brain that can provide important information about many neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic diseases, etc.

##### Raw CEST Image consists of data at various saturation frequencies forming a Z- spectrum, which acts as an input to the model.
